This is a simple version of pacman where there are not yet powerups or fruits, 
and the grid has each tile at the same size, so a different sized level would 
require a different sized window. The file begins with some global constants
such as the level map, colors and sizes that will be needed by multiple 
functions. Then it moves into player and ghost classes and then finishes with 
the game loop that calles methods of the above classes and draws the board. You
can also reference the diagram below:
